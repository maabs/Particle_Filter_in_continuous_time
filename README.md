# Particle_Filter_in_continuous_time
This code applies a slight variation of the standard particle filter in continuous time (Crisan and Bain, Fundamentals of Stochastic Filtering) coded in python.


The code is a direct application of the paper "Multilevel particle filters for the non-linear filtering problem in continuous time" by Ajay Jasra · Fangyuan Yu · Jeremy Heng. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-020-09951-9  In the article the Particle filter is used as a base for the Multilevel particle filter. In this repository I add the file of the particle filter alone. 


The code is built in a general fashion in which we can define functions for the state space model.
